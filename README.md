# Open Source Culture / 开源文化


In this course you will be introduced to Open Source from different
perspectives; such as:

  * where it came from
  * what it means to software development, and
  * why companies/enterprises are looking at adoption
     
But the most important question for us what does Open Source really mean and how
people contribute to a community that does Open Source software development. Our
particular focus will be dealing with OpenStack contributions.
    
At the end of this course you will understand the principles of communication,
actions and tooling related to your work within and with the OpenStack community.
