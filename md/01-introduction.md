# Open Source Culture

### Introduction to Open Source


## What is Open Source


## History
Free Software Movement


## History
Informal software sharing


## 1983
Richard Stallman publishes the GNU Manifesto

explanation and definition of the goals of the GNU Project


## GNU Project
give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices, by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on the freedoms

users are free to run the software, share it (copy, distribute), study it and modify it.


## 1989
First version of the GNU General Public License

gives permission to modify the work, as well as to copy and redistribute the work or any derivative version


## Four freedoms


## 0. The freedom to
run the program as you wish, for any purpose


## 1. The freedom to
study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish

Access to the source code is a precondition for this.


## 2. The freedom to
redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor


## 3. The freedom to
distribute copies of your modified versions to others


## Four freedoms
By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.

Access to the source code is a precondition for this.


## 1991

Linux is [announced](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ) as a hobby project

```
I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and 
professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.
```

```
Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
```

frustrated by the licensing of MINIX


## 1992
Linux relicensed under the GPL

The original license prohibited commercial redistribution.

Naming controversy


## Relicensing allowed to create a 'commercial' version

triggered adoption by enterprise market; they could get support in the form of services.


## Red Hat starts selling support contracts


## Ambiguous use of 'free'
Eric S Raymond, Red Hat, et al introduce a new term


## Open Source


## Open Source
clearly explains the intention of freedom to study

cultural issues between use of the terms 'free' and 'open'. Source code is 'freely' available to see.


## Open Source
is an ideology / way of doing

promotes collaboration/sharing of ideas

the licensing promotes the re-use of material


## Open Source
is not only about software

  * Open Hardware
  * Open CourseWare (MIT)
  * Wikipedia (CC-licensed)


## Successful projects

  * Mozilla Firefox  
    1998, Netscape open source
  * LibreOffice  
    2010, forked from OpenOffice
  * Apache HTTP Server
  * OpenStack


## Successful companies
  * Red Hat 
  * MySQL
  * JBoss
  * SuSE, Novell
  * Xensource
  * Mirantis


## LAMP
web service solution stack

Became popular because it is entirely free and open-source software

  * interchange without vendor lockin
  * 'free of cost' popularized it


## LAMP
consists of

  * Linux operating system
  * Apache HTTP Server
  * MySQL database
  * PHP programming language

variants exist, but the ease of use of the components allowed rapid application development


## Reasons for adotion

  * lower cost
  * security
  * no vendor 'lock in'
  * better quality

security and better quality comes from the idea 'many eyes makes for secure code'.

quality comes from practices such as 'code review'.


## Lower cost
Often mistaken as 'free of cost'.  
Charged in the form of services or  support.

Even if the source code is available at no charge, there is still a cost involved with maintenance and training of staff.


## Vendor 'lockin'
customer is dependent on a vendor for products and services

  * network equipment
  * proprietary formats
  * camera lenses


## Upstream
the original authors or maintainers of software.

patch 'sent upstream' means offered to the author for inclusion.


## Upstream
Downstream deviations

  * patches
  * aditional sources
  * different dependencies
  * configuration options

Note: exceptions can exist


## Upstream
Deviations can lead to issues

  * maintenance problems
  * documentation inconsistency
  * security problems
  * quality coverage


### Backporting
merge fixes to a different version

can become painful over time (or even impossible and conflicting)


## Upstream
Advantages to 'upstreaming'

  * Common Benefit and Reduced Maintenance Burden
  * Documentation (formal and informal)
  * Translations
  * Quality Assurance
  * Fast incremental improvements
  * User feedback


## Upstream
Advantages to 'upstreaming'

  * Common knowledgebase
  * Marketing
  * Trust and confidence

prevents knowledge assymmetry between project and provider and/or provider and customer.


## Open Core

  * Open Source for the core
  * Addons are commercially sold

licensing is often not ideal to allow re-use of the corein other projects


## Advantages of doing OSS

  * purely technical requirement
  * can lead to industry standard
  * lowers cost of marketing


## Disadvantages of doing OSS

  * possible neglect of documentation
  * possibility of untested code

large projects enforce documentation and reviewing.
