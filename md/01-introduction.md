# Open Source Culture

### Introduction to Open Source

---

## What is Open Source

---

## History
### Free Software Movement

Note: The difference between free and open.

---

## History
### Informal software sharing

---

## History
### 1983
Richard Stallman publishes the GNU Manifesto

Note: explanation and definition of the goals of the GNU Project

---

## GNU Project
give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices, by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on the freedoms

Note: users are free to run the software, share it (copy, distribute), study it and modify it.

---

## History
### 1989
First version of the GNU General Public License

Note: gives permission to modify the work, as well as to copy and redistribute the work or any derivative version

---

## Four freedoms

---

## The freedom to
### run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).

---

## The freedom to
### study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).

Note: Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

---

## The freedom to
### redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).

---

## The freedom to
### distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).

---

## Four freedoms
### By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.

Note: Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

---

## History
### 1991
Linux is announced as a hobby project

```
I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and 
professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.
```

```
Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
```

Note: frustrated by the licensing of MINIX. https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ

---

## History
### 1992
Linux relicensed under the GPL

Note: his original license prohibited commercial redistribution. Naming controversy => GNU/Linux

---

## Relicensing allowed to create a 'commercial' version

Note: triggered adoption by enterprise market; they could get support in the form of services.

----

## Red Hat starts selling support contracts

---

## Ambiguous use of 'free'
### Eric S Raymond, et al introduce a new term

---

## Open Source

---

## Open Source
### clearly explains the intention of freedom to study

Note: cultural issues between use of the terms 'free' and 'open'. Source code is 'freely' available to see.

---

## Open Source
### is an ideology / way of doing
promotes collaboration/sharing of ideas

Note: the licensing promotes the re-use of material

---

## Open Source
### is not only about software
  * Open Hardware
  * Open CourseWare (MIT)
  * Wikipedia (CC-licensed)

---

## Successful projects
  * Mozilla Firefox  
    1998, Netscape open source
  * LibreOffice  
    2010, forked from OpenOffice
  * Apache HTTP Server
  * OpenStack

Note: Star Office was open sourced as OpenOffice in 2000 by Sun.

---

## Successful companies
  * Red Hat 
  * MySQL
  * JBoss
  * SuSE, Novell
  * Xensource
  * Mirantis

Note: some of these companies have been acquired

---

## LAMP
### web service solution stack

Note: become popular because it is entirely free and open-source software
  * interchange without vendor lockin
  * 'free of cost' popularized it

---

## LAMP
### consists of
  * Linux operating system
  * Apache HTTP Server
  * MySQL database
  * PHP programming language

Note: variants exist, but the eas of use of the components, such as mod_php allowed rapid application development

---

## Reasons for adotion
  * lower cost
  * security
  * no vendor 'lock in'
  * better quality

Note: security and better quality comes from the idea 'many eyes makes for secure code'. quality comes from practices such as 'code review'.

---

## Lower cost
Often mistaken as 'free of cost'.  
Charged in the form of services or  support.

Note: Even if the source code is available at no charge, there is still a cost involved with maintenance and training of staff.

---

## Vendor 'lockin'
customer is dependent on a vendor for products and services
  * network equipment
  * proprietary formats
  * camera lenses

---

## Upstream
the original authors or maintainers of software.

Note: patch 'sent upstream' offered to the author for inclusion.

---

## Upstream
### Downstream deviations
  * patches
  * aditional sources
  * different dependencies
  * configuration options

Note: exceptions can exist

---

## Upstream
### Deviations can lead to issues
  * maintenance problems
  * documentation inconsistency
  * security problems
  * quality coverage

---




---

## Open Core
### Open Source for the core
### Addons are commercially sold

Note: licensing is often not ideal to allow re-use of the corein other projects

---

## Advantages
  * purely technical requirement
  * can lead to industry standard
  * lowers cost of marketing

---

## Disadvantages
  * possible neglect of documentation
  * possibility of untested code

Note: large projects enforce documentation and reviewing.
